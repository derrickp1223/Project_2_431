# Motivations for Agda:
- A proof assistant with ordinary programming constructs such as data types, pattern matching, records, let expresions and modules. 
- Interactive Development: Have a toplevel that allows immediate feedback on code

# Characteristics:
Typing: strong, static, dependent, nominal, manifest, inferred

- Syntax is Haskell-Like
- Strong, static type system including dependent types.
- Can be used as a proof assistant because of dependant types.
- Total language, so program must terminate and cover all possible cases
- No runtime Errors because of strong typing and total requirements
- Modules and records for organization and structure
