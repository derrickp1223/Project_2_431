We installed Agda using ghcup since we have it already from using Haskell,
with two commands:
cabal update
cabal install Agda
If you do not have cabal you go do ghcup tui and install it.

To setup the libraries you can download them with 
the command:
wget -O agda-stdlib.tar https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/archive/v2.1.1.tar.gz
and then unzip them with:
tar -zxvf agda-stdlib.tar
lastly go into your agda/libraries file and add:
$HERE/agda-stdlib-2.1.1/standard-library.agda-lib
